# Cross-sell application

This application was created as a university project which aims to simulate a real life business assignement concerning on-line shops.

## What does it do
Our application is an on-line shop, which in addition recommends various categories and new products for each user based on his/hers particular history. 

## How to use it

In order to obtain your own history of views you need to sign in with your original name.

Then you can view any category and any product you want. When you have selected a category, only products from this particular category will be displayed and recommended. 

After you have gone back to the main page new categories and 5 new products from the whole e-shop will be recommended based on the products and categories you have already visited.

## How does it work

The application returns recommendations based on history of views using Word2vec recommendation engine. 
The web application uses Dash in Python.

## How can YOU try it?

Unfortunately his application does not run on a webside since the trained recommendation model and the data required for the application are too big. 
However you can see few pictures of the application in the folder: pictures.

Most of the text in the application is in CZECH.
